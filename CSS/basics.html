CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
The CSS syntax consists of a set of rules. A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon

Example:
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 12px;
    }

In this example, h1 is the selector, and color: blue; and font-size: 12px; are declarations
The most common CSS properties include:
color - sets the color of text
background-color - sets the background color of an element
font-size - sets the size of the font
font-family - sets the font of the text
margin - sets the space around elements
padding - sets the space between the content and the border of an element
border - sets the border around elements
text-align - sets the alignment of text

CSS can be added to HTML documents in three ways:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by linking to an external CSS file using the <link> element

Example of inline CSS:
<h1 style="color:blue;">This is a blue heading</h1>

Example of internal CSS:
<head>
<style>
h1 {
    color: blue;
    }
</style>
</head>

Example of external CSS:
<head>  
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
In this example, styles.css is the name of the external CSS file
CSS is a powerful tool for web designers and developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites
