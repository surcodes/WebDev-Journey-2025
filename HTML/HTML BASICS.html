What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

HTML elements are represented by tags
HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets: <tagname>
HTML tags normally come in pairs: <tagname>content</tagname>
The first tag in a pair is the opening tag, the second tag is the closing tag   
The closing tag is written like the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the tag name
Example: <p>This is a paragraph</p>
The text between the opening and closing tags is the element's content
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: <p>This is a paragraph</p>

HTML documents
An HTML document is made up of different HTML elements
An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content in between
Some HTML elements do not have an end tag (e.g., <img> and <br>)
The HTML document has a nested structure, with elements inside other elements

The HTML document starts with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5

The HTML document is enclosed in <html> tags
The <head> element contains meta information about the document

The <title> element specifies a title for the document (shown in browser's title bar or tab)
The <body> element contains the visible page content
    
Example of a simple HTML document:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
</body>
</html>

HTML Attributes
HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element
Attributes are always included in the opening tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
Common HTML attributes include:
id - specifies a unique id for an element
class - specifies one or more class names for an element (used for CSS and JavaScript)
style - specifies an inline CSS style for an element
title - specifies extra information about an element (displayed as a tooltip)
Global attributes can be used on any HTML element (e.g., id, class, style,
title)

HTML Comments
Comments in HTML start with <!-- and end with -->
Comments are not displayed in the browser
Comments can be used to explain the code, which can help when you edit the source code later
Example:
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- Comments can also be used to hide code from the browser -->
<!-- <p>This paragraph is hidden and will not be displayed in the browser.</p> -->
<!-- Comments can help to organize your HTML code -->
<!-- and make it more readable -->
<!-- Always remember to close your comments properly -->

HTML is not a programming language
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content
HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language
HTML is not a stylesheet language (CSS)
HTML is not a scripting language (JavaScript)
HTML is used to create the structure of web pages, while CSS is used to control the layout and appearance, and JavaScript is used to create dynamic and interactive elements on the page.

HTML is the backbone of all web pages
Without HTML, web pages would not exist

HTML5 introduces new elements and attributes that allow for more powerful and flexible web pages
HTML5 is designed to be compatible with older versions of HTML
HTML5 is supported by all modern web browsers
HTML5 is the future of web development
