HTML Comments
Comments in HTML start with <!-- and end with -->
Comments are not displayed in the browser
Comments can be used to explain the code, which can help when you edit the source code later
Example:
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- Comments can also be used to hide code from the browser -->
<!-- <p>This paragraph is hidden and will not be displayed in the browser.</p> -->
<!-- Comments can help to organize your HTML code -->
<!-- and make it more readable -->
<!-- Always remember to close your comments properly -->
