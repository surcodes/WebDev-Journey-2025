An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
The start tag consists of the element's name enclosed in angle brackets, like <p> for a paragraph element.
The end tag is similar but includes a forward slash before the element's name, like </p> for closing the paragraph element.
HTML elements can also be self-closing, meaning they do not have an end tag, such as <img> for an image element or <br> for a line break.
HTML elements can be nested, meaning one element can contain another element inside it.
For example, you can have a paragraph element that contains a link element: <p>This is a <a href="https://www.example.com">link</a> inside a paragraph.</p>
HTML elements can also have attributes, which provide additional information about the element.
Attributes are specified in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs, like href="https://www.example.com" for a link element.
HTML elements are the building blocks of an HTML document, and they define the structure and content of the web page.
HTML elements can be combined to create complex web pages, with different elements working together to display text
and images, create links, and structure the content in a meaningful way.

HTML documents
An HTML document is made up of different HTML elements
An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content in between
Some HTML elements do not have an end tag (e.g., <img> and <br>)
The HTML document has a nested structure, with elements inside other elements
The HTML document starts with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5

HTML elements can also include forms, which allow users to input data and interact with the web page.
HTML elements can also include tables, which allow for the organization of data in rows and columns.
HTML elements can also include lists, which allow for the organization of items in a structured format.
HTML elements can also include multimedia content, such as audio and video, which can enhance the user
experience and provide additional information on the web page.
HTML elements can also include semantic elements, which provide meaning to the content and help with search engine optimization.
HTML elements can also include interactive elements, such as buttons and input fields, which allow users to
interact with the web page and perform actions.
HTML elements can also include navigation elements, which help users navigate through the web page or website.

HTML elements are represented by tags
HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets: <tagname>
HTML tags normally come in pairs: <tagname>content</tagname>
The first tag in a pair is the opening tag, the second tag is the closing tag   
The closing tag is written like the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the tag name
Example: <p>This is a paragraph</p>
The text between the opening and closing tags is the element's content
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: <p>This is a paragraph</p>
