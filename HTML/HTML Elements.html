An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
The start tag consists of the element's name enclosed in angle brackets, like <p> for a paragraph element.
The end tag is similar but includes a forward slash before the element's name, like </p> for closing the paragraph element.
HTML elements can also be self-closing, meaning they do not have an end tag, such as <img> for an image element or <br> for a line break.
HTML elements can be nested, meaning one element can contain another element inside it.
For example, you can have a paragraph element that contains a link element: <p>This is a <a href="https://www.example.com">link</a> inside a paragraph.</p>
HTML elements can also have attributes, which provide additional information about the element.
Attributes are specified in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs, like href="https://www.example.com" for a link element.
