HTML Attributes
HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element
Attributes are always included in the opening tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
Common HTML attributes include:
id - specifies a unique id for an element
class - specifies one or more class names for an element (used for CSS and JavaScript)
style - specifies an inline CSS style for an element
title - specifies extra information about an element (displayed as a tooltip)
Global attributes can be used on any HTML element (e.g., id, class, style,
title)

Attributes can also be used to control the behavior of elements
For example, the disabled attribute can be used on form elements to prevent user interaction:
<input type="text" disabled>
The checked attribute can be used on checkboxes to indicate that they are selected by default:
<input type="checkbox" checked>
The readonly attribute can be used on input fields to make them non-editable:
<input type="text" value="Read only text" readonly>
Attributes can also be used to enhance accessibility
For example, the alt attribute provides alternative text for images:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
Attributes can also be used to improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
For example, the rel attribute can be used in links to specify the relationship between the current document and the linked document:
<a href="https://www.example.com" rel="nofollow">This is a link</a>
The target attribute can be used to specify where to open the linked document:
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">This link opens in a new tab</a>
Attributes can also be used to control the behavior of scripts
