What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

The HTML document starts with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5

The HTML document is enclosed in <html> tags
The <head> element contains meta information about the document

The <title> element specifies a title for the document (shown in browser's title bar or tab)
The <body> element contains the visible page content
Example of a simple HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
</body>
</html>

HTML is not a programming language
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content
HTML is used to create the structure of web pages, while CSS is used to control the layout and appearance, and JavaScript is used to create dynamic and interactive elements on the page.
HTML is the foundation of web development
HTML is the backbone of all web pages
Without HTML, web pages would not exist
HTML is not case sensitive, meaning that <html> and <HTML> are treated the same
HTML is constantly evolving
The latest version of HTML is HTML5
HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML
HTML5 introduces new elements and attributes that allow for more powerful and flexible web pages
HTML5 is designed to be compatible with older versions of HTML
HTML5 is supported by all modern web browsers
HTML5 is the future of web development
