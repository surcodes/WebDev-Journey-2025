HTML Headings
HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags
HTML headings are used to create a hierarchy of content on the page
The <h1> tag defines the most important heading, while the <h6> tag defines the least important heading
Headings are block-level elements, meaning they take up the full width available and start on a
new line
Headings can be used to structure the content of a web page, making it easier for users
to read and understand
Example:
<h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is a Heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is a Heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is a Heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is a Heading 6</h6>
Headings can also be styled using CSS to change their appearance, such as font size, color, and alignment
Headings are important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) as they help search engines understand the structure and content of the page
