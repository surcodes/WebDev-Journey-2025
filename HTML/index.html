What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

HTML elements are represented by tags
HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets: <tagname>
HTML tags normally come in pairs: <tagname>content</tagname>
The first tag in a pair is the opening tag, the second tag is the closing tag   
The closing tag is written like the opening tag, but with a forward slash before the tag name
Example: <p>This is a paragraph</p>
The text between the opening and closing tags is the element's content
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: <p>This is a paragraph</p>

HTML documents
An HTML document is made up of different HTML elements
An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content in between
Some HTML elements do not have an end tag (e.g., <img> and <br>)
The HTML document has a nested structure, with elements inside other elements

The HTML document starts with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5

The HTML document is enclosed in <html> tags
The <head> element contains meta information about the document

The <title> element specifies a title for the document (shown in browser's title bar or tab)
The <body> element contains the visible page content
    
Example of a simple HTML document:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
</body>
</html>

HTML Attributes
HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element
Attributes are always included in the opening tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
Common HTML attributes include:
id - specifies a unique id for an element
class - specifies one or more class names for an element (used for CSS and JavaScript)
style - specifies an inline CSS style for an element
title - specifies extra information about an element (displayed as a tooltip)
Global attributes can be used on any HTML element (e.g., id, class, style,
title)

HTML Comments
Comments in HTML start with <!-- and end with -->
Comments are not displayed in the browser
Comments can be used to explain the code, which can help when you edit the source code later
Example:
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- Comments can also be used to hide code from the browser -->
<!-- <p>This paragraph is hidden and will not be displayed in the browser.</p> -->
<!-- Comments can help to organize your HTML code -->
<!-- and make it more readable -->
<!-- Always remember to close your comments properly -->
